Applications could include:

permission to make your claim
permission to send papers to a defendant outside England or Wales 
a request for a hearing without notifying the defendants

After you submit and pay for your claim, you’ll have until the end of the next working day to make your application. If you do it any later, your application will not be considered and a hearing will be scheduled as normal.

If you’re not sure whether you need to make an application as part of your claim, you should get legal advice. ​`,
