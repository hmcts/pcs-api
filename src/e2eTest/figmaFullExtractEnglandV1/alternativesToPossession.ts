Suspension of right to buy

A suspension order means that the defendants will not have a right to buy the premises during the suspension.

Demotion of tenancy

A demotion order means that the defendants’ current tenancy will be replaced with a demoted tenancy. During this period (usually 12 months) they will lose some rights they currently have. The claimant is able to propose a new set of terms that will be put in place by the demotion order.`,
